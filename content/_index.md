Hello!

I am a Software Engineer and Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Genoa. I'm also Research Assistant at University of Sassari, giving my contribution in the CERBERO European project. During my studies I always kept an eye on the industry world, working in different realities. If you want to know more about me and my background visit my blog or follow me in one of the many social networks out there.
