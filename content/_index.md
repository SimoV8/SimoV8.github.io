Hello!

I am a Software Engineer and Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Genoa. 
I'm also Research Assistant at University of Sassari, where I'm working on the [CERBERO](https://www.cerbero-h2020.eu/) and [FitOptivis](https://fitoptivis.eu/) H2020 European projects. 
During my studies I always kept an eye on the industry world, working in different realities.
